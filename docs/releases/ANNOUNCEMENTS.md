Releasing OpenBoost 1.0.0rc1 🚀

GPU-accelerated GBDT variants in pure Python.

NGBoost, InterpretML EBM? Slow, CPU-only.
OpenBoost brings them to GPU → 2-50x faster (benchmarks + caveats in the repo).

Plus: fully readable, customizable. Built for the AI coding era.

pip install openboost

🧵 Thread on why this matters...

The problem with XGBoost/LightGBM:

Want a custom loss? → Write C++, recompile
Want a custom predictive distribution? → Not happening
Want to debug training? → Good luck with C++ stack traces

With OpenBoost: it's all Python. Custom losses, custom distributions, selectable growth strategies (levelwise/leafwise/symmetric). Modify, reload, done.
```

What's included:

✅ NaturalBoost (NGBoost → GPU, 1.6-11x faster on GPU)
✅ OpenBoostGAM (InterpretML EBM → GPU, 56x faster on our run; accuracy tradeoff — see repo benchmarks)
✅ DART, LinearLeaf, multi-GPU
✅ Standard GBDT (use XGBoost if you need speed)
✅ Full sklearn compatibility
```

Why "built for the AI coding era"?

When you ask Claude/ChatGPT to modify XGBoost's tree building...it can't help.

Ask it to modify OpenBoost? It can read the code, suggest changes, and help you implement new algorithms.

AI can't help with C++ monoliths. It can with Python.

### Tweet 5
```
Coming soon: native "train-many" optimization.

Industry reality:
- Hyperparameter tuning = 100s of models
- Cross-validation = k models  
- Per-segment models = 1000s of models

XGBoost optimizes for 1 model fast.
OpenBoost will optimize for many models efficiently.
```

### Tweet 6
```
Try it:

pip install openboost

import openboost as ob
model = ob.GradientBoosting(n_trees=100)
model.fit(X, y)

Feedback welcome! This is rc1 - looking for battle testing before 1.0.

🚀 Announcing OpenBoost 1.0.0rc1

I've been working on something different: GPU-accelerated gradient boosting written entirely in Python.

**The Problem**
XGBoost and LightGBM are incredible libraries, but they're 200K+ lines of C++. Want a custom loss? A new predictive distribution? A different tree growth strategy? You need C++ expertise and hours of build time.

**The Solution**
OpenBoost GPU-accelerates GBDT variants that were previously CPU-only and slow:

**What's Included**
• NaturalBoost - probabilistic predictions (NGBoost → GPU, 1.6-11x faster on GPU)
• OpenBoostGAM - interpretable models (InterpretML EBM → GPU, 56x faster on our benchmark, with an accuracy tradeoff — details in the repo)
• Standard GBDT, DART, LinearLeaf (for custom algorithms; use XGBoost for production speed)
• Full sklearn compatibility

**Why Now?**
In the era of AI-assisted development, code readability matters more than ever. An AI assistant can help you modify Python code. It can't help with C++ monoliths.

**Coming Next: Train-Many Optimization**
Industry workloads often require training many models (hyperparameter tuning, per-store models, cross-validation). XGBoost optimizes for one model fast. OpenBoost is building native support for training many models efficiently.

Try it: pip install openboost
Docs: https://jxucoder.github.io/openboost

This is rc1 - I'm looking for feedback and battle testing before the final 1.0 release. Would love to hear from anyone using gradient boosting in production.

### Title
```
[P] OpenBoost: GPU-accelerated gradient boosting in pure Python (20K lines vs XGBoost's 200K C++)
```

### Body
```
I've released OpenBoost 1.0.0rc1, a gradient boosting library written entirely in Python with GPU acceleration via Numba.

**Why another GBDT library?**

XGBoost and LightGBM are engineering marvels, but they're essentially black boxes to most users. 200K+ lines of C++, complex build systems, CUDA kernels you can't modify without serious expertise.

OpenBoost takes a different approach: ~20K lines of Python that GPU-accelerates GBDT variants that were previously slow and CPU-only.

**What's included:**
- NaturalBoost: NGBoost → GPU (1.6-11x faster on GPU, dataset-dependent)
- OpenBoostGAM: InterpretML EBM → GPU (56x faster on our benchmark run, with an accuracy tradeoff; comparison details in the repo)
- DART, linear-leaf models, multi-GPU via Ray
- Standard GBDT (use XGBoost for production speed; OpenBoost for readability/customization)
- Full sklearn compatibility

**The "agentic era" angle:**
When you're working with AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.), they can actually help you modify OpenBoost's algorithms. They can read the tree building code, understand it, and help you customize it. They can't do that with C++ monoliths.

**Planned: train-many optimization**
Industry workloads often need to train many models (hyperparameter tuning, CV, per-store/per-product models). XGBoost optimizes for training one model fast. OpenBoost's Python architecture enables native optimization for training many models efficiently - batching, GPU parallelization across models.

**Installation:**
```
pip install openboost
pip install openboost[cuda]  # GPU support
```

**Links:**
- Docs: https://jxucoder.github.io/openboost
- GitHub: https://github.com/jxucoder/openboost
- Examples: https://github.com/jxucoder/openboost/tree/main/examples

This is rc1 - looking for feedback before 1.0. Happy to answer questions about the implementation or benchmarks.

Show HN: OpenBoost – GPU gradient boosting in pure Python (20K lines vs XGBoost's 200K C++)
```

### Body
```
I built OpenBoost because I wanted to understand and modify gradient boosting algorithms without diving into C++.

XGBoost and LightGBM are incredible, but they're inaccessible to most practitioners. Want to add a custom loss function? Add a new distribution for probabilistic predictions? Switch tree growth strategy? You need C++ expertise. (OpenBoost supports all three today: custom losses, custom distributions with autodiff, and levelwise/leafwise/symmetric growth. A pluggable split-criterion API is roadmap, not shipped — though the split code is plain Python you can edit.)

OpenBoost is ~20K lines of Python using Numba for GPU acceleration. It brings GPU to GBDT variants that were previously CPU-only and slow.

Key insight: NGBoost and InterpretML EBM are great algorithms trapped in slow Python implementations. OpenBoost GPU-accelerates them:
- NaturalBoost: 1.6-11x faster than NGBoost on GPU (dataset-dependent; CPU is ~parity)
- OpenBoostGAM: 56x faster than InterpretML EBM on our benchmark run, with an accuracy tradeoff (benchmark details and caveats in the repo)

For standard GBDT, use XGBoost/LightGBM. For variants and custom algorithms, OpenBoost fills the gap.

Features:
- Probabilistic predictions with GPU acceleration
- Interpretable GAMs with GPU acceleration
- DART, linear-leaf models, multi-GPU via Ray
- Full sklearn compatibility

The "agentic era" motivation: I use AI coding assistants daily. They can help me modify Python code. They can't help with 200K lines of C++. OpenBoost is designed to be readable and modifiable by both humans and AI.

**Coming soon: train-many optimization.** Industry reality is often training hundreds or thousands of models (hyperparameter search, CV, per-segment models). XGBoost optimizes for training one model fast. OpenBoost's architecture enables batching and GPU parallelization across models - optimize for training many models at once.

This is rc1. Feedback welcome.
